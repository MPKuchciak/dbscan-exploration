## Overview

This project explores **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**, a powerful clustering algorithm well-suited for datasets with **arbitrary shaped clusters** and **noise/outliers**. The analysis provides a step-by-step exploration of DBSCAN's core principles, parameter optimization, and practical implementation on a synthetic dataset.

The project aims to demonstrate the practical application of DBSCAN through:

- **Cluster detection** in datasets with varying densities and shapes.
- **Noise and outlier identification**.
- Visualization of the clustering process, including epsilon-neighborhood reachability and k-distance graphs for parameter tuning.
- A synthetic dataset with diverse clusters to showcase DBSCAN's flexibility and robustness.



## Project Files

- **`DBSCAN.Rmd`**: R Markdown document containing the full analysis, including methodology, data creation, parameter optimization, and visualizations of the DBSCAN algorithm.
- **`README.md`**: This README file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the analysis.
